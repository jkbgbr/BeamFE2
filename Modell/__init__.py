# todo: currently
# todo: enable drawing the structure without having an analysis performed previously
# todo: BCs -> support objects
# todo: re-think plotting/drawing

# Tests:
#   todo: the moment reactions in the linear elastic analyses are ALWAYS incorrect, when the node of reaction is a j node, the sign should be opposite
#   parallel uniform, parallel concentrated loads
# Lin stat:
#   calculating stresses (Sections need stress points for this...)
# Modal:
#   check added mass etc. Chopra example with higher resolution
#   tests
#   modal masses, modal participation
#   EC-based stuff: modal antwort, summation...
# Buckling:
#   implement.
# draw:
#   beautify: scaling all drawn elements.
#   draw with subplots for lin stat
#   draw global reaction forces
#   draw moment loads


# todo: LATER
# Lin stat:
#   LATER: defining hinges?
#   LATER: 3D Beam element?
# Modal:
#   ability to convert loads to masses - through defining gravity and its direction
#   LATER: ability to choose which directions mass act?
