Missing / todo:
* setup.py
* pypi
* query for the results as written in BeamFE2/__init__.py
* buckling analysis
* proper scaling of the displayed results
* moment loads need a graphical symbol
* global reaction forces should be displayed
* modal masses, modal participations
* jupyter notebooks?
* code optimization
* code for displaying needs a cleanup



# todo: currently
# todo: enable drawing the structure without having an analysis performed previously
# todo: BCs -> support objects
# todo: re-think plotting/drawing

# Lin stat:
#   query maximum values/positions for all internal actions within a beam element
#   calculate stresses due to N, M, V in the sections
#   query maximum stresses on given beams / in interval
# Modal:
#   modal masses, modal participation
#   EC-based stuff: modal antwort, summation...
# Buckling:
#   implement.
# draw:
#   beautify: scaling all drawn elements.
#   draw with subplots for lin stat
#   draw global reaction forces
#   draw moment loads

# todo: LATER
# Lin stat:
#   LATER: defining hinges?
#   LATER: 3D Beam element?
#   calculating stresses from internal actions (Sections need stress points for this...)
# Modal:
#   ability to convert loads to masses - through defining gravity and its direction
#   LATER: ability to choose which directions mass act?
